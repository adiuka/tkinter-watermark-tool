# An app that uses a very basic Tkinter GUI to watermark a selected image with a transparent (or not...) logo or text

Find an example in the created_images folder and a transparent logo and an example image to watermark in the assets folder.
The app is completely not finished, as it lacks any sort of intuitive functionality. I used is as another benchmark to learn how to work with images, tkinter and most importantly CLasses and inherritance.
Many things are still hard coded, like the positionig of the water mark. Logo adjustment logic is also not working yet.
Next on the agenda:
1. Add better explanations of my thought process.
2. Migrate to another GUI, or use a Tkinter template for a better looking UI.
3. Add functionality that allows you to specify the save path.
4. Implement logo scaling logic based on image size
5. Add customizable functionality for fonts, color etc.
